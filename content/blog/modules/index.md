description: Working With React Can Be Difficult If You Don't Understand ES6 Modules. Take A Quick Dive Into ES6 Modules & Save Time Now!
---

I just started working in React this month and didn't understand why I had to export and import components before I could use them. I didn't even know import and export were actually a new Javascript feature that was debuted with ES6. After finally picking up a book on learning react by Orielly, did I finally realize modules are within ES6.

Please follow along and learn about ES6 modules.

## What Is A Javascript Module Anyway?


This time last week I was working at home on a Saturday trying to finish my end of month report's for my wonderful clients. I work as SEO and Google Ads manager at [Uptown Studios](https://uptownstudios.net/). I have had this job for seven months and it has been the best work experience of my life. 

When my daughter was born, my boss/not boss [Tina Reynolds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uptownstudios/) hired me knowing my wife was due one month after my first day of employment. She knew I would need to take some time off immedately after starting work, yet she hired me anyway. She is such a wonderful person.

When my baby was born, my wife and I found out our new baby daughter had [Spina Bifida](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/spinabifida/facts.html). Indeed, this was devasting for the both of us and my fantastic team at Uptown Studios was there to support me every step of the way. 

## 1. Work-Life Balance Is A Real Thing 

Flash forward 5 months after many medical tests, foot surgery, and MRI's. My baby daughter was getting her pre-operation tests at the hospital. 

It was towards the end of the month and I was finishing up all of my work as fast as I could, knowing the next couple of weeks would be very hard to accomplish anything work wise. 

My wife was nervously packing all of our little familie's belongings and snacks for a week long spinal surgery and recovery. We didn't know what to expect, but all I had on my mind was the following:

- Finish work - **ASAP**!
- Book a nice hotel close to the hospital
- Call all of my close friends and family for support
- Play with my baby daughter like it is the last time I may see her

Working remotely from home gave me the freedome to work when I could. I usually work from the office hours 9 am to 6 pm. However, at home I usually start work at noon and finish up work later in the night. 

This gives me plenty of time to enjoy my morning with my little loving family. My wife and I get to play with our daughter when she is really happy after a long restful night of sleeping. This is when my daughter is happiest. 

She _smiles_ and _laughs_ and _looks_ into your eyes like she knows you are her parents who will do anything to keep her happy. We really love our daughter and I am so lucky I get to work remotely and spend my mornings with her. 

Especially on a day when we know she is going to have a life changing surgery which she might not wake up from or possibly wake up a differnt baby. 

## 2. Sticking To A Well Thought-Out Plan Saves Lives 

Collaborating with a team of neural surgeons, doctors, pediatricians, nurses, administrators, social workers, insurance agents, family, friends, co-workers, clients, other sympathetic parents, and a tired 5 month old baby may seem daunting. It is not when you stick to a well thoughout plan.

> We Have You Covered For The Week, 
> Tell Us If You Need Anything,
> Give Your Family Our Love. - Tina Reynolds

My daughter's surgeon, aka - _The Man_ - name everyone at the hospital game him, received her MRI results and determined the tethered chord was running rampant on her poor little body. The Man decided to pull the trigger and schedule her spinal surgery 6 month's earlier than expected. 

The Man surgeon infomred us right away that our daughter's surgery would be at the beginning of June and we would need to prepare immediately. 

We informed all of our friends and family via text, cell phone, facebook, instagram, blog, and in person. 

I informed my boss/not boss Tina Reynolds and she said the most relieving thing a boss could ever tell their employee - "We have you covered for the week, tell us if you need anything, and give your family our love." Have I said how wonderful she is yet?

In addition, my marketing team slacked me thumbs-up and heart emojis with some supporting words offering their time if we needed it. My boss/not boss and team knew, now I could be present for my wife and baby daughter. 

**NOTE:** My amazing wife created a [Meal Train](https://www.mealtrain.com/) profile so our friends could send us lunch and dinner while we nervously waited. Yes she really did do this, and yes meals delivered from your friends across the country are as delicious as they sound. 5 stars on execution and brilliance.

## 3. Time Flies, Even During Difficult Situations

Our daughter's recovery was the hardest thing my wife and I have gone through so far in our one year of marriage. We were both nervous and tired for her whole recovery and we got on each others nerves more than once. 

Luckily time has a way of smoothing things out between loved ones during good times and bad. 

> Feels like we didn't even leave, but we definitely did. - My Wife

During my dauther's revovery, my wife and I split time at her bedside with 12 hour shifts. I took the nights, which were from 8 pm to 8 am, and she took the days, vice versa. It was a greuling schedule for the both of us. 

During the day my wife had constant interruptions with nurses, doctors, and surgeons checking in on our daughter and asking millions of questions. 

Luckily, my wife is a lawyer and is smart enough to answer all of their questions like she was a peer. She always gets asked "are you in the medical profession?" 

Night shift was the complete opposite, only one nurse on duty and she would leave me alone, only to come in and catherize my daugther and make sure she was getting her meds. 

I slept for most of my shift on a recliner next to my daughters crib, waking up to help the nurse cath my daughter's bladder and feed her in between med refills. 

When we were there it felt like forever, but once we got home, my wife said "feels like we didn't even leave, but we definitely did". Very well said and wraps our whole experience up very well. 

## Conclusion

Our daughter is now home at 5 months old. After her spinal surgery she can now wiggle her toes and move her ankles, something she hasn't been able to do since she was born. 

She is now moving her feet in front of her and trying to grab these unknown appendiges like a newborn chick flapping its wings for the first time.

Her successful spinal surgery has inspired me to keep pursuing my passion of web development and has given me faith to write this blog. I will keep writing about my learnings from my family, work, and studies. Hope you will enjoy my ride, because so far I have!
